# Finance-Claude

A Claude Code project that fields a **10-person autonomous finance team** connected to live TradingView charts. Agents collaborate through a shared workspace, debate each other's findings, and produce structured investment memos with entry plans, warning flags, and a full audit trail.

---

## The Team

| Tier | Agent | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Meta | `orchestrator` | Master brain — gates research, spawns agents, synthesizes |
| Tool | `data-engineer` | Fetches and packages all raw financial data |
| Tool | `research-analyst` | Senior finance domain expert — moat analysis, expert thesis, hard recommendation |
| Tool | `quant-analyst` | Factor models, backtests, statistical signals |
| Tool | `chart-analyst` | Supply/demand zones via TradingView MCP (scored 0–100) |
| Actioner | `signal-tracker` | Watches zones for entry confirmation, fires ENTRY_SIGNAL |
| Actioner | `risk-manager` | VaR, stress tests, stop levels, position limits |
| Actioner | `portfolio-manager` | Allocation decision, conviction score, trade plan |
| Actioner | `compliance-officer` | Regulatory sign-off on all client-facing output |
| Actioner | `report-writer` | Bilingual investment memo with score card and audit trail |

**Tool agents** write shared briefs. **Actioner agents** consume those briefs and decide. Actioners never re-gather data.

## MCP Servers (6)

Six servers, each with a non-overlapping purpose. No redundancy.

| Server | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| `tradingview` | Live chart access via TradingView Desktop CDP — candles, indicators, zones |
| `financial-analysis` | Built-in Python tools: DCF, ratios, portfolio P&L, stock data, FX |
| `sqlite` | Local financial database — cached data, signal logs, trade history |
| `fetch` | Lightweight HTTP: SEC EDGAR, FRED, direct API calls |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for JS-heavy research pages and regulatory portals |
| `polymarket` | Crowd-implied event probabilities (read-only, no trading) |

**Guiding principle:** Use the best source for the job, then stop. `tradingview` is the only source for chart data. `financial-analysis` is the first call for any calculation. `fetch` covers most data APIs without launching a browser. `playwright` only when a page requires JavaScript execution.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Node.js 18+ (for MCP servers via npx)
- Python 3.11+ (for `financial-analysis` plugin)
- TradingView Desktop (for chart analysis — Windows only)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joneswong96/Finance-Claude.git
cd Finance-Claude

# Install the financial-analysis Python plugin
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### API Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The current 6-server stack needs no API keys by default:

```env
# Optional — only needed if you restore removed MCPs
# POLYMARKET_PYTHON=~/tools/polymarket-mcp-server/venv/bin/python
# POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY=...   # only if using Polymarket in live mode
# POLYGON_ADDRESS=...
```

`tradingview`, `financial-analysis`, `sqlite`, `fetch`, and `playwright` all require no API keys.
`polymarket` runs in read-only `DEMO_MODE=true` — no keys needed for market queries.

### Local overrides

```bash
cp CLAUDE.local.md.example CLAUDE.local.md
# Fill in machine-specific context (your positions, watchlist, etc.)
```

---

## TradingView MCP Setup

TradingView Desktop must be running with **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** enabled before chart analysis will work.

### Windows (recommended)

```bat
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

This script launches TradingView Desktop with CDP on port 9222 and verifies the MCP server can connect.

### Manual launch

```bat
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\TradingView\TradingView.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Then start Claude Code — the `tradingview` MCP server connects automatically via `.mcp.json`.

### Verify connection

Once Claude Code is open, run:
```
/scan XAUUSD
```
If chart-analyst returns zone data, TradingView MCP is working.

## How Analyses Work

### Fundamental analysis (`/analyze`)

```
[Research Gate] → data-engineer (01_data.md)
              → research-analyst + quant-analyst in parallel (03a + 03b)
              → cross-debate rebuttals (04a + 04b)
              → orchestrator synthesis (04c) with named warning flags
              → risk-manager (05_risk.md)
              → portfolio-manager (06_portfolio.md)
              → report-writer (07_memo.md) ← final output
```

### Technical analysis (`/scan` + `/watch`)

```
chart-analyst → zones scored 0-100
signal-tracker → waits for confirmation inside zone → ENTRY_SIGNAL
risk-manager → approves SL/size
portfolio-manager → executes
```

All analysis files land in `workspace/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}/` and are gitignored.

### Research Gate

Before any research is commissioned, the orchestrator scores the request:
- **High materiality OR high novelty** → proceed
- **Low on both** → skip, use cached knowledge, flag assumption

Inside research, the analyst runs: **Shallow Scan** (default) → **Standard Analysis** → **Deep Dive** (triggered by Why Triggers: >2σ deviation, conflicting signals, crowd divergence >15pp).

---

## Output Format

The final memo includes:
- **Score card** — 0-100 composite score, grade, market regime, win-rate probability, named warning flags
- **Trade plan** — batched entry prices + amounts (BUY) or liquidation schedule (SELL), stop-loss, two-stage take-profit
- **Investment thesis** — bull/base/bear scenarios with probabilities and targets
- **Agent audit trail** — every agent's key finding and verdict in one table
- **Unresolved disagreements** — never silently resolved

## Safety

- **Permissions** — `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves safe commands; blocks `rm -rf`, force push, secret reads
- **Hook** — `.claude/hooks/block-large-data-files.sh` blocks files >50MB and known secret patterns
- **Gitignore** — excludes `.env`, credentials, data files, workspace output
